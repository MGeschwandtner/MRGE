# MRGE Case Study

## Task

Use Case for Data Engineering

### Challenge Overview

In this challenge, you will be tasked with designing and implementing a data pipeline that seamlessly integrates mage.ai, a cutting-edge data ingestion and transformation tool, with dbt (data build tool), a powerful analytics engineering tool. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to create a streamlined and scalable data processing workflow from raw data to actionable insights.


### Key Components

- Data Ingestion with Mage.ai
- Transformation and Modeling with dbt
- Pipeline Orchestration

## Architecture Thoughts

- for showcase reasons develop something lightweight
- can be partly local
- as we only use a little amount of ressources the dwh architecture can also be lightweight
  

## Architecture Decision
- go with etl process
- add bigquery as dwh
- use github for code documentation / revisiontool
